## X3D


</div>

### Description

X3D is a 3D Engine written in pure VB code. It uses GDI32 to draw 2D Polygons, but all the 3D Rendering code is in VB. Special thanks to Nick Levar. I don't know him but I got the code to rotate an object from his book: Animation Magic. The rest is mine. X3D is well commented and uses Z-Buffering, 3D Rendering, and a simple form of shading.
 
### More Info
 
You must read the readme file!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This will show you how to get X3D To work. Also, you must compile final engine1.vbp(The engine) in order to run the test/dem program in the test folder.
